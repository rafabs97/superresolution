# A comparison of neural network-based super-resolution models on 3D rendered images.
Support code for training and testing the studied methods, implemented using TensorFlow 2.

**NEW (11/09/2023)**: Try our models in this Colab Notebook. [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/103bUKKtmtoPEAlzNRo1eyMpn2wCBovqq?usp=sharing)

To superresolve an image using one of the provided models, use the demo.py script:

```
python demo.py models/<model.h5> <path to image>
```

Some example images:
